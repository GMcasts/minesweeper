##Minesweeper TAP
When I learned the origins of [Minesweeper](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)#History) date back to the 60s and 70s I had to implement it for myself. 

Through together this version in a similar style to the Windows version that I had grown up with. Really simple implementation that I turned into an iOS app.
